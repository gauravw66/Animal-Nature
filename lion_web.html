                <p>Nearly all wild lions live in sub-Saharan Africa, but one 
                       small population of Asiatic lions exists in India's Gir Forest. 
                       Asiatic lions and African lions are subspecies of the same species.
                       Asiatic lions once prowled from the Middle East to India. Now, only a fraction of these 
                       magnificent animals survive in the wild. The Gir Forest's dry teak woods were once a royal hunting ground. 
                       Today they are a reserve where these at-risk big cats are heavily protected.
                       <br>
                       Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. Prides are family units that may include up 
                        to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related and female
                        cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and may establish their own 
                        prides by taking over a group headed by another male.
                        Only male lions boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads. 
                        Males defend the pride's territory. They mark the area with urine, roar menacingly to warn intruders, 
                        and chase off animals that encroach on their turf.
                        Female lions are the pride's primary hunters. They often work together to prey upon large mammals.

                <h2>Protection Scheme</h2>
                <p>
                    The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project is an initiative of the Indian Government to provide 
                    safeguards to the Asiatic lion from extinction in the wild by means of reintroduction. 
                    The last wild population of the Asiatic lion is found in the region of Gir Forest National Park, 
                    in the state of Gujarat. The single population faces the threats of epidemics, natural disasters 
                    and other anthropogenic factors. The project aims to establish a second independent population of 
                    Asiatic lions at the Kuno National Park in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
                    However, the proposed translocation has been bitterly contested by the state government.

                <h2>Reason of Endangerment</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons why lions are disappearing is that their homes are being destroyed. 
                        Many endangered lions live in grassland and forest areas of Africa and India. As the human population increases, 
                        these lion habitats are destroyed in order to create more homes and buildings for people.
                        In the wild, they have all they need to survive, but they are targeted by humans for their pelt or fur, 
                        which is sold to people who want Asian Lion leather jackets. They also have two distinct sorts of food to consume.
